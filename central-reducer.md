# Reducers

Normally, when using Reduxigen, you don't need to worry about reducers. The management of reducers  and actions are handled for you. However, you may be curious about how Reduxigen works under the covers. You may encounter a situation where you want to write your own reducer. Or, you may need to integrate an existing application with Reduxigen's Central Reducer, and you want to be able to use Reduxigen alongside existing Redux code.

If you want to learn more about how Reduxigen manages reducers, read the [Central Reducer](/central-reducer/central-reduc.md) article.

If you want to learn how to integrate Reduxigen to work alongside an existing Redux application--without needing to update much of the existing code--read the [appendReducers](/appendReducers) article.
