# Connect {#connect}

Wiring up props and actions to a react component is a pain. Reduxigen’s `connect` method aims to simplify this by doing the work for you. It does this by creating the `mapStateToProps` and `mapDispatchToProps` functions for you, then calling `react-redux`'s `connect` method.

```js
import * as actions from "./booking-actions";
import connect from "reduxigen/connect";

// Your component here.

const stateMap = ["pickup", "dropoff", "pickupDate", "time", "cars", "cars_loading"];
export default connect(stateMap, actions)(Home);
```

`connect` supports nested properties. There are two ways to work with them. By default, `connect` will map nested propeties to nested properties. For example:

```js
const store = {
  test: {
    nested: {
      val: expected
    }
  }
};

const sampleComponent = props => (
  <h1>{props.test.nested.val}</h1>
);

export default connect(["test.nested.val"])(sampleComponent);
```

`connect` uses [`lodash/get`](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#get) under the hood, so it supports any valid `lodash` getter path string.

Alternatively, you can create aliases for nested properties, using ‘as’ syntax:

```js
const store = {
  test: {
    nested: {
      val: "myVal"
    }
  }
};

const sampleComponent = props => (
  <h1>{props.val}</h1>
);

export default connect(["test.nested.val as val"])(sampleComponent);
```

Finally, it also supports functions. Passing functions can be useful when you want to display computed properties. 

`connect` injects the `state` into any function passed to it. It expects, therefore, that any function it works with will have one argument, `state`, in its method signature \(e.g., `function myMethod(state) { }`\). The following example demonstrates using a `reselect` selector:

**The Selector**

```js
import { createSelector } from 'reselect'
​
const getVisibilityFilter = state => state.visibilityFilter
const getTodos = state => state.todos
​
export const getVisibleTodos = createSelector(
  [getVisibilityFilter, getTodos],
  (visibilityFilter, todos) => {
    switch (visibilityFilter) {
      case 'SHOW_ALL':
        return todos
      case 'SHOW_COMPLETED':
        return todos.filter(t => t.completed)
      case 'SHOW_ACTIVE':
        return todos.filter(t => !t.completed)
    }
  }
)
```
