# Integration

If you have an existing Redux application, and would like to work with Reduxigen, but don't want to convert all of your existing code--no problem! Reduxigen exposes an `appendReducers` function that achieves something simliar to Redux's `combineReducers`.  For more information, read the artilce on [appendReducers](/central-reducer/appendreducers.md).
