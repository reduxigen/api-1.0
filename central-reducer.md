# Reducers

Normally, when using Reduxigen, you don't need to worry about reducers. The management of reducers is handled for you.

If you want to learn more about how Reduxigen manages reducers, read the [Central Reducer](/central-reducer/central-reduc.md) article.

If you want to learn how to integrate Reduxigen to work alongside an existing Redux application--without needing to update much of the existing code--read the [appendReducers](/appendReducers) article.
