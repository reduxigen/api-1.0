# Reduxigen {#reduxigen}

Reduxigen is a ridiculously simple React state management system built on top of Redux that is incredibly robust.

### Simple {#simple}

Working with state in Reduxigen entails only two concepts:

* State

* Functions

In Reduxigen, as in Redux, your state is a plain JavaScript object.

Reduxigen functions update values in the state.\*

### Robust {#robust}

If you've used Redux, many of the concepts in Reduxigen will be very familiar. However, you'll find using Reduxigen much simpler than Redux. You'll write less code, which will make you more efficient, and less prone to error. At the same time, you'll get all the benefits Redux has to offer.

---

\* More accurately, Reduxigen functions create a new state with appropriately updated values.
